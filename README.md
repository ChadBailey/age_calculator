This is a simple age calculator for the planets I made out of curiosity when reading [Astronomy 101](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Astronomy-101/Carolyn-Collins-Petersen/Adams-101/9781440563591), a book I picked up from [humble bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/books/knowledge-101-adams-media-books)

It can be easily adapted to give an age on any celestial body by extending the `planet_orbital_periods` dictionary.
